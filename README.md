My first Python coding project. Yes, I've recreated the wheel here as there are many programs to scrape Yahoo Finance. Nevertheless, recreating the wheel is a great way to learn how to program.

I haven't had time to really maintain the code. Yahoo Finance has changed its website since this was first created. Thus, it can no longer scrape the financials tab of the Yahoo Finance website. However as of mid-October 2020, I'm doing some maintenance. 
 
I've used it for my job at the Motley Fool. I sometimes pull inspiration from it for Medium.com articles.

Yahoo Finance: Just added multithreading to pull years of price history data. 

Nasdaq: Nasdaq earnings and dividend calendars

TMX: TMX used to provide a free API to pull data in json format --- but it has been shut down and now they are charging for access. Thus, this code no longer works, but it was a pretty easy project while it lasted.

TDAmeritrade API: I can't actually ever publish full code for this because I'm concerned about hackers accessing my TDAmeritrade account. There's still some work I need to do with it like setting it up to renew auth codes upon expiration to avoid me having to do this manually. I'm putting these "to do's" on my calendar in the future.
