The communications.ipynb is a good test file to demonstrate the commands to use the module.

stock_scraper.py, earnings.py, and balance_sheet.py are the primary program files – I’ve tried to keep it simple and easy to learn how to use. It still needs some debugging, and I’ve been expanding on it whenever I use it. It is constantly changing. I want to set it up to SQLlite to store the stock information.
