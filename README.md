scraper.py: Scrapers used throughout each of these files live in scraper.py
    This file contains scrapers for every tab at the url finance.yahoo.com/quotes/symbol


calendar.py: This is a minor accompanying file which will scrape the earnings calendar.
    I have spent less time testing and optimzing this for use, but if anyone is interested in
    expanding upon it, please feel free to reach out to me with questions, concerns, and comments.


Iâ€™ve tried to keep it simple and easy to learn how to use.
Remember: It is still in testing stages. So, feel free to use and contribute to the project.
If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.
